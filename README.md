BESTEM Hackaton Within a 24-hour period, my team used data analytics and machine learning techniques,
including clustering using DistilBert, SARIMAX, and supervised learning models, to forecast product sales and stock levels
based on seasonal trends, for an ecommerce company. Also, we developed a dashboard for visualization and
monitoring of these metrics using data that was stored in a PostgreSQL database system.
